# Chapter 2: The Sound Enthusiast's Appreciation of Sound

As you venture into the world of audio systems, you may come across a myriad of descriptive terms thrown around in reviews and forums – words like 'bright', 'forward', 'dark', and more. These terms might seem abstract, perhaps even esoteric, painting a picture of the audio world as a mysterious realm that requires 'golden ears' to fully appreciate.

Well, we're here to dispel that myth. 

Contrary to this perception, appreciating great audio does not necessitate a superhuman level of auditory perception. Indeed, the realm of audio power amplifiers is grounded in the concrete and measurable. Every important parameter – whether perceptible or not to the human ear – can be quantitatively and scientifically discussed. 

In other words, the world of sound doesn't have to be shrouded in ambiguity. Yes, certain terms and concepts might be hard to grasp initially, but with a solid understanding of the underlying principles and parameters, you'll be able to navigate it with clarity and confidence.

## The Subjective Appreciation of Sound

The subjective audiophiles are quite the enigmatic group within the audio community, often seen rejecting objective measurements and singing praises for instruments that, technically speaking, showcase poor distortion figures. 

Now, you might be asking, "Why would anyone adore a system that is scientifically inferior?" Well, that's the crux of subjectivism. It's a belief that relies heavily on personal experience and emotional response, often discarding hard, empirical data.

Unfortunately, this subjective approach can contribute to widespread misunderstandings. The endorsement of technically inferior systems, the discarding of empirical measurements, and the use of abstract, undefined terms can all muddle the water for newcomers and casual consumers. 

Moreover, subjective audiophiles can unintentionally sway marketing strategies. Buzzwords and 'audio jargon' that stem from these subjective experiences often find their way into product descriptions, further fueling the misconception that good sound is synonymous with complex terminology and high prices.

The ideal way to assess sound quality should be a blind comparison - a comparison where the listener doesn't know which product they're hearing. This method helps remove potential biases that come from knowing the price, brand, appearance, build quality, or weight of the equipment.

Sadly, many online (or magazine) reviews don't follow this method. Reviewers often know the product they're assessing, which may bias their judgment, knowingly or unknowingly. The shiny knobs, the brand's reputation, or the equipment's hefty price tag can all subtly influence their perception of the sound.

Here at Amplifinity, we encourage a balanced approach. While personal experience and emotional connection to sound are undeniably important, they should be accompanied by a good understanding of the underlying science. This way, we can appreciate sound in all its beauty, without losing sight of the principles that make it all possible.
