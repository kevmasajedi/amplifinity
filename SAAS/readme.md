# Chapter 2: The Sound Enthusiast's Appreciation of Sound

As you venture into the world of audio systems, you may come across a myriad of descriptive terms thrown around in reviews and forums – words like 'bright', 'forward', 'dark', and more. These terms might seem abstract, perhaps even esoteric, painting a picture of the audio world as a mysterious realm that requires 'golden ears' to fully appreciate.

Well, we're here to dispel that myth. 

Contrary to this perception, appreciating great audio does not necessitate a superhuman level of auditory perception. Indeed, the realm of audio power amplifiers is grounded in the concrete and measurable. Every important parameter – whether perceptible or not to the human ear – can be quantitatively and scientifically discussed. 

In other words, the world of sound doesn't have to be shrouded in ambiguity. Yes, certain terms and concepts might be hard to grasp initially, but with a solid understanding of the underlying principles and parameters, you'll be able to navigate it with clarity and confidence.
